Thanks for the help provided to me in the past month, which has taught me a lot.

Here are some new questions:

1. If there are these three sentences during CM7 initialization, it will cause a crash (green LED keeps on)

    ```C
    int main(void) {
    // Other codes
    MX_SDMMC1_SD_Init();
    MX_USB_OTG_FS_HCD_Init();
    MX_USB_OTG_HS_HCD_Init();
    // Other codes
    }
    ```

2. The CM7 program cannot be scheduled normally, but CM4 has no problems.
	Possible cause: There is no task scheduled to CM7. But I checked the code of cmsis_os2.c and found that the `osThreadNew` function did call the `xTaskCreate` registration task, and also confirmed that the task priority of CM7 is higher, so why is this happening? Is there any way to check?

3. About the development of ArduinoCore-freertos.
	Now it seems that I just need to implement some functions with `stm32h7xx_hal`, but this work has already been done by `ArduinoCore-mbed`, which is a mature project, what is the significance of this?

ArduinoCore-freertos, the code that needs to be modified is in the `/ArduinoCore-freertos/arduino-core` directory, both `.h` and `.cpp` need to be modified, the main job is to replace the original mbed code with stm32_hal

I wrote some code and found that the efficiency is low and the availability cannot be guaranteed. The new solution: replace rtos in mbed-os with freertos, mainly to connect several APIs

I found relevant information in mbed's github and forum, and found that this problem is not as simple as I thought, and it is temporarily put on hold. Revert to the previous plan.

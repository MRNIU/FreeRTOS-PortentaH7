Current thinking: refer to mbed and replace the code with freertos.

mbed is actually a layer of abstraction, which further encapsulates the HAL, and actually uses the HAL interface at the bottom of it.

The HAL header file is specified by the -I parameter, and the implementation is in the static library libs/libmbed.a.

The build is done by the makefile, the libraries needed are used, and the parameters are inferred from the arduino compilation output. If some parameters cannot be obtained, try to compile using arduino ide.

- Step
     1. Repackage the stm32h7xx_hal_*.o series files to complete the underlying support.
     2. cmsis, the static library of cmsis is not found, it may just use the header file part of the definition
     3. Compiling FreeRTOS requires changes to the automatically generated code

Carry on with yesterday's work.

Try to write makefile to compile arduino-mbed.



# Dev log 20200610

There are three parts to be compiled

1. ino files, compiled into .o files
2. Arduino core, compiled to .a file

Link, output as .elf

1. ino.o, compiled from the ino file
2. core.a, compiled from the core file
3. stm32hal.a, compiled from stm32h747

objcopy, output as .bin

Basically build the makefile framework and start to try to transplant

First comment out the implementation of the original function

Write makeilfe for freertos

# Dev log 20200613

The preparation of makefile is basically completed, but due to the change of the source directory structure, a lot of `#incldue` went error, and it takes a lot of effort to change it, and plans to reorganize the code tomorrow.

Compare the code provided by freertos with the generated code

The last step: the startup file, in libs/libmbed.a

dfu command:

M7 `dfu-util --device 0x2341:0x035b -D ./ino.bin -a0 --dfuse-address=0x08040000:leave`

M4 `dfu-util --device 0x2341:0x035b -D ./ino.bin -a0 --dfuse-address=0x08100000:leave`

I am currently testing whether freertos can run normally. I wrote a blink program to perform this step, but I do not know what went wrong and it has no effect. . . I am looking for bugs, which is a headache.

After this step is completed, you can start to transplant ArduinoCore, mainly some glue code and specific implementation.

hi, there is a strange bug. I am trying to light the LED PK6, but the board did not react.

this is the main.c for CM7: https://github.com/MRNIU/FreeRTOS-PortentaH7/blob/master/CM7/main.c



# Dev log 20200625

- Relationship between p7 board, FreeRTOS, ArduinoCore
	Run freertos on p7, encapsulate the stm32 hal function into an arduinocore function, and use freertos for management.

So the task of freertos-p7 is to run freertos on p7

arduinocore-freertos is function encapsulation

# Dev log 20200626

The stable reaction was observed on the board for the first time!



# Dev log 20200627

The problem is located

```c
int main(void)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */

  /* USER CODE END 1 */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN Boot_Mode_Sequence_0 */
    int32_t timeout;
  /* USER CODE END Boot_Mode_Sequence_0 */

/* USER CODE BEGIN Boot_Mode_Sequence_1 */
  /* Wait until CPU2 boots and enters in stop mode or timeout*/
  timeout = 0xFFFF;
  while((__HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D2CKRDY) != RESET) && (timeout-- > 0));
  if ( timeout < 0 )
  {
   // Here
   Error_Handler();
  }
//  ...
}
```

`  while((__HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_D2CKRDY) != RESET) && (timeout-- > 0))` timedout

M4 core is not awakened



# Dev log 2020060703

Solve the problem that M4 cannot be awakened, the error has the following points

1. You need to configure the clock in M7 and wake up M4 manually, you can use `HAL_RCCEx_EnableBootCore(RCC_BOOT_C2)`
2. Do not set the clock again in M4, otherwise it will conflict with M7 and cause an error
3. The link script specifies the wrong start address
